Ready2Go
========

Ready2Go is a Rasbian (Debian) based distro for the RasberryPi

Hey, I'm planning on building a distro pretty similar to MiningPeon for the RasberryPi, but with a few neat features here and there,

Base OS : Rasbian  

Planned feature list, 
- [ ] Graphs -- Todo
- [ ] Auto(Updater) - So you won't need to mess around compiling the latest cgminer by hand ;) --Todo 
- [ ] WebUI - Display status of each device plugged in --Todo 
- [ ] CGminer support (latest from Git) --Done
